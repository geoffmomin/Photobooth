## Photobooth

Photobooth is an app in which the user uploads photos to a database, can add/delete labels for the photos by hand, and allows the user to filter photos based on the labels or just show their favorites. It uses Google Cloud Computer Vision API to automatically detect and provide labels for the uploaded photos.
